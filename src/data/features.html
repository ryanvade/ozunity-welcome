            <p class="paragraph">To build upon the 'Manjaro' base and provide a system which intermediate Linux users would find inviting and intuitive to use, enhanced with applications that the majority of users would require on a day by day basis which could easily be tailored to any individuals needs. We will continue to evolve into something that will become indispensable for personal computer users world wide.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Burn the downloaded ISO 'image' to a DVD and then boot from the DVD. Alternatively if you don't have an optical drive, you can create a startup disk to USB flash drive and then boot your computer from there.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If you would like to be part of this project, you are more than welcome to do so in whatever form you would like. From a tester, suggester to artist and coder. It should be fun and informative and together we may well just change the world.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Oz Unity Manjaro Beta is based on the Manjaro core. This is a rolling release base. Whilst we've tried to test on as many different units as we could there is no guarantee it will work on all. If you like this remix, then GREAT! if not, thanks for trying but please don't 'hate' - we're simply trying to 'give back' to a community that has given us so much. -Moebius </p>
